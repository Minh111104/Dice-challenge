# Dice Game

This is a simple **Dice Game** created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players roll virtual dice, and the game determines the winner based on the random dice rolls.

## How It Works

- The game generates two random numbers, one for each player, simulating the roll of a dice.
- The corresponding dice images are updated dynamically.
- The result (Player 1 Wins, Player 2 Wins, or Draw) is displayed based on the dice rolls.

## Features

- Random dice roll (values from 1 to 6).
- Dynamic image update for both dice.
- The result is updated with a custom message:
  - "🏆 Player 1 Wins!" if Player 1's dice roll is greater.
  - "Player 2 Wins! 🏆" if Player 2's dice roll is greater.
  - "Draw!" if both players roll the same value.
